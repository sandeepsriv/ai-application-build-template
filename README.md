PLAN.md 
------
While your Agent is working on building the application, you must keep asking it to - 

"Please confirm that PLAN.md is up to date with all the latest, including any design decisions you have made. Let me know when ready."

This is because while it is working on your project, it keeps filling up the context window and may run out of space. You may have to restart/refresh the context window from "zero," and it makes sense for your agent to preserve the work it has done.
